# linktree flutter clone

## Looking for Flutree? ðŸ‘€ Find them in [v3](https://github.com/iqfareez/linktree-clone-flutter/tree/v3) and [web](https://github.com/iqfareez/linktree-clone-flutter/tree/web) branch. I'm not planning to merge them into the master branch. ðŸ˜„

## Modification

- Font is from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Replace profile picture with your own picture. There are two type you can use, NetworkImage or AssetImage, you can use AssetImage by replacing `/images/sample.jpg` with your own picture (keep the filename same). Then make some changes with the dart code if necessary.
